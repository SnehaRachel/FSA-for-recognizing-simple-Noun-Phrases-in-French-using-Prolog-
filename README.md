# FSA-for-recognizing-simple-Noun-Phrases-in-French-using-Prolog-
The FSA is non-deterministic. The start state is 1 and the final(accept) state is 3. The supported word categories are determiners, wh-determiners, quantifiers, common nouns, proper nouns, adjectives (occuring before and after the noun), prepositions and conjunctions.
A sample lexicon has been included. 
Future work to create a Noun Phrase generater for french nouns could be made by incorporating FSTs to handle gender and plural marking suffixation.
